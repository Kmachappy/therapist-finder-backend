    description: "Welcome, and thank you for taking the first steps towards healing, it's a beautiful, eye opening journey. I chose this line of work to provide others with the skills they need for walking their life path with their heads held high and love in their hearts. At some point we are all given difficult, transformative opportunities. I would be grateful to assist in honoring life's painful experiences and integrating them as they transform you into something greater. As a yoga teacher, therapist, and spiritual seeker I use healing modalities that shift the mind, body, and soul.\\n\\ My care will provide a safe space to cultivate an understanding of the symptoms present and how they fit into your life story. I will introduce tools to alleviate and integrate symptoms. These tools will be life longs skills that leave you feeling empowered at life's twists and turns.\\n\\ I find stimulating the mind, giving the body a voice, and listening to the soul to be the three most important components of healing. Each session will incorporate techniques for relaxing the body, talk therapy for stimulating the mind, and ritual for getting in touch with the soul. I graduated from Regis University it 2014 and completed my 200 hour yoga teacher training in 2012. Healing and spirituality have always gone hand in hand for me. Since 2014 I have been in private practice using my holistic approaches to healing. Over time I found my niche and began creating programs for women to feel empowered and step into their Divine Feminine Essence. I have created programs and memberships for women to continue their studies of the Divine Feminine which include: healing your body image, practicing self love, creating relationship with your heart and womb space, following your dreams, and living a life of joy and bliss. I also have plenty of male clients, I find my male clients enjoy calling in their Divine Masculine and stepping up into the men they have always wanted to be. In this way, I have also become an empowerment coach and help people go after the lives they have always wanted.",

    description: "Welcome! So your path has brought you here to BetterHelp, it's likely you are looking for some assistance in dealing with something in your life or your current situation and hope to find a person that can offer that assistance. Perhaps you have found that person right here!\\n\\Stepping into therapy can be an overwhelming process but finding the right fit for you is one of the most important aspects of making it work. My hope is our work together is that you feel heard, valued, and supported in whatever you are facing.\\n\\ I work to empower individuals towards being authentic whole beings. I use a strengths-based approach to help find the silver lining. Research has shown that physical mental emotional and spiritual well-being all play equally significant roles and our livelihood. Therefore I have made the holistic approach my central modality when it comes to my therapy. \\n\\My style is purposefully eclectic, to best serve your needs as a client. I believe strongly in a collaborative process in designing counseling experiences. You are the expert on you, the techniques we will use may change depending on your style and needs. Every individual is unique, and no one orientation will serve all.",

    description: "Before becoming a counselor I moved away from home to snowboard, worked in software and social services, and learned to cope with family substance problems, social anxiety, and harrowing fears of flying and public speaking, . I've worked with migrant families, veterans, couples, rural and urban clients, and people who struggle with meth and heroin. I am also formally trained in play therapy, EMDR, CBT, and substance abuse counseling. I believe that we take on a story that can feel unchangeable, and that it can be very helpful to learn to disrupt our own status quo and change the story.",

    description: "Behavioral or mood changes are often the first indications that someone is struggling or hurting. It is not uncommon for people to face challenges as they navigate through life. Although the challenges vary in severity, the effects can seem overwhelming. During these times, people who are struggling are often unable to recognize the tools within them. I work to empower my clients so that they can better adjust and cope. I work to create a supportive and nurturing environment. I help clients to build on existing strengths and find relief.\\n\\I am passionate about my work and enjoy empowering clients to see real changes in their lives. I focus on the presenting concerns and incorporate information regarding client history as it relates to their current level of functioning. I provide support and skills to help clients effectively address personal life challenges. I am an interactive, solution-focused therapist and I integrate a variety of techniques to provide support and practical feedback in order to effectively assist clients with overcoming personal life challenges. I readily utilize cognitive behavioral therapy, narrative therapy and strength-based approaches to treatment.\\n\\ I received my Bachelors Degree from The University of Colorado at Boulder and my Masters Degree in Clinical Counseling Psychology from The Chicago School of Professional Psychology.",
